What you do is you break into someone's house, you open up their luggage, as someone who's about to travel, you open up their luggage, and you get inside the bag of holding, in their luggage. Then, after you're through airport security, and after you're on the plane in the baggage part, you get out, you rummage through everyone's luggage, and you steal all of the expensive valuables. You have more than enough time to do this because you're on the plane. Then, you put all the valuables back in your bag of holding, and you get in your bag of holding, and you get back in anyone's luggage."""

idea2 = """You find the house of somebody who's a high-up official in the government. You break into their house and you get, in the bag of holding, in their work bag, in a pocket that seems to not be opened, or not often be opened. You stay in there until they go to work at some high-level security base. You have your head peeked outside of the bag and you listen for when the bag is set down. Then you get out of the bag. You can take pictures or you can steal documents. And then, any time you need to hide or at the end of your session, when you just want to get out of the base, you get back in the bag and back in the person's backpack or whatever they're carrying and they safely escort you out of the base."""
